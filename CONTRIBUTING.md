## üåü How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues
If you have bugs or improvement suggestions, first check [Issues](https://github.com/your-username/github-accounts/issues).

#### Bug Reports
Please include the following information:
- **Environment**: OS, Python version, GitHub CLI version
- **Reproduction Steps**: Specific steps to reproduce the issue
- **Expected Behavior**: What you expected to happen
- **Actual Behavior**: What actually happened
- **Error Messages**: Related error messages or logs

#### Feature Requests
Please include the following information:
- **Background**: Why this feature is needed
- **Detailed Specification**: What kind of functionality you expect
- **Use Cases**: Specific usage scenarios

### 2. Code Contributions

#### Development Environment Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository
# Please fork the repository on GitHub

# 2. Clone locally
git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-accounts.git
cd github-accounts

# 3. Add upstream repository
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-username/github-accounts.git

# 4. Setup development environment
make install-gh
make install

# 5. Create configuration file (for testing)
make setup
```

#### Branching Strategy

- `main` branch is the stable version
- Feature additions use `feature/feature-name` branches
- Bug fixes use `fix/bug-description` branches
- Documentation updates use `docs/update-content` branches

```bash
# Branch creation examples
git checkout -b feature/add-new-export-format
git checkout -b fix/memory-leak-in-data-processing
git checkout -b docs/update-installation-guide
```

#### Coding Standards

##### Python Code
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Use type hints (Python 3.7+)
- Line length limit: 120 characters

```python
def fetch_team_members(org: str, team: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Fetch team members for the specified organization.
    
    Args:
        org: GitHub organization name
        team: Team name
        
    Returns:
        List of member information
        
    Raises:
        APIError: When GitHub API error occurs
    """
    # Implementation...
```

##### Makefile
- Use tab indentation
- Explain the purpose of each target with comments
- Implement proper error handling

##### YAML Configuration Files
- Use 2-space indentation
- Explain configuration items with comments

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_config_loader.py -v

# Run tests with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=. --cov-report=html
```
